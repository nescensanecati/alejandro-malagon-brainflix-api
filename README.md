# Brainflix Website
Brainflix is a Brainstation bootcamp project, this project took three weeks (one week counted as a sprint during the bootcamp)

Week eight of the bootcamp was when sprint three was completed and the site was delivered for a final evaluation.

Eight weeks into the bootcamp, it was time to be more involved into using HTML, SCSS, JS, React, responsive sites, and a client/server structure.

The site was developed to be reactive and to change the format at three sizes:
- less than 786 pixels > then use mobile formatting
- between 786 pixels and less than 1280 pixels > then use tablet formatting
- more than 1280 pixels > then use desktop formatting

This site is using a backend API that can be checked in the Git repository:

The API was adapted to be run in production, and it is now running in Heroku, under the domain:
